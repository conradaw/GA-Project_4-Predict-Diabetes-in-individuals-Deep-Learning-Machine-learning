    "### **Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Singapore, a significant portion of the population under 40 years of age experiences heightened levels of loneliness and social isolation, with these feelings particularly acute among those aged 21 to 34. This demographic reports a preference for online communication over face-to-face interactions, often due to social anxiety and the pressure of societal expectations. These challenges are compounded in the workplace, where over half of the workforce struggles with trust and meaningful relationships, leading to further feelings of isolation and disconnection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advent of open-dialogue chatbots, which can engage users in meaningful, empathetic conversations, presents a potential solution to these issues. By leveraging principles from psychology such as the Social Penetration Theory, which suggests that gradual and reciprocal sharing of personal information can deepen relationships, and Attachment Theory, which implies that secure relationships can be therapeutic, an open-dialogue chatbot could serve as a first step in alleviating loneliness. The chatbot could provide a non-judgmental, always-available platform for individuals to express themselves and practice social interactions, thereby reducing social anxiety and improving their ability to form deeper human connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a chatbot could simulate empathetic and engaging conversations, offering both emotional support and practical advice for navigating social situations. It could also encourage users to explore their feelings in a safe environment, potentially making it easier for them to open up to others in real life. By addressing these psychological needs, the chatbot aims to reduce the loneliness epidemic among Singapore's younger population, improving their mental health and overall well-being.\n"

    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many chatbots struggle to maintain user engagement over time, which is essential for building a trusting relationship. Gaining user trust requires a careful approach to conversation that encourages openness without forcing intimacy. Users will be more likely to open up to entities they feel understand them on a personal level.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a chatbot that acts as a daily companion, engaging users with friendly, casual conversations and activities that encourage regular interaction, thereby laying the foundation for deeper emotional support. The chatbot will learn from each interaction to personalize conversations, making itself more relatable and trustworthy, which is crucial for eventual mental health counseling. The chatbot will use techniques from counseling psychology, like open-ended questions and reflective listening, to encourage users to share their feelings and experiences naturally over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot will therefore serve as a conversational AI buddy by building long-term engagement through personalized interactions that will facilitate emotional disclosure.\n"
